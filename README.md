We named the overall folder “The codes involved in the paper”. We have saved the weight calculation code for the paper in the Weight calculation code folder, including AHP weight, critical weight, and improved game theory combination weight. These are reflected in Table 3 of the paper.
We've archived the code for the linear regression model in the "Linear_fitting_regression_model" file, along with relevant code snippets for PSO-LSTM and PSO-MSVM in their respective directories. These are used in Figures 7 and 8 of the paper. The pearson_correlation code is used to analyze Figure 9. The Nonparametrica_significance_test code is used to analyze Figure 10. Additionally, the codes for fuzzy comprehensive evaluation under the trapezoidal, triangular, and Gaussian membership functions are stored in the files "Fuzzy_comprehensive-evaluation_trapezoid_this_paper", "Fuzzy_comprehensive-evaluation_Triangle_shape", and "Fuzzy_comprehensive-evaluation_Gaussian", respectively, as depicted in Figure 11 of the paper.
